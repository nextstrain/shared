Helper functions to set-up storage plugins for remote inputs/outputs. See the
docstring of `path_or_url` for usage instructions.

The errors raised by storage plugins are often confusing. For instance, a HTTP
404 error will result in a `MissingInputException` with little hint as to the
underlying issue. S3 credentials errors are similarly confusing and we attempt
to check these ourselves to improve UX here.
